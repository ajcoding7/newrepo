                <div class="intro">After narrowly avoiding relegation the previous season. Against all odds, Huddersfield Town achieved promotion in the 2016/2017 EFL Championship season under newly appointed manager, David Wagner. Wagner had been in charge of Dortmund's second team in Germany before leaving for Huddersfield, he would recruit 5 new german players from his homeland to join him for the new season. The new signings had an instant impact and proved vital in Huddersfield's success. However, of all the new recruits, defender Christopher Schindler stands out. Becoming a fan favourite, and by the end of the season, a club legend.</div>
